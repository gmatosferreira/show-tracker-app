# Web app to track series and movies

This project was developed in the context of [Human-computer Interaction](https://www.ua.pt/en/uc/2484) curricular unit, part of the Computer Science Bachelor at [Aveiro University](https://www.ua.pt/).

It was graded **B+** (the next and highest level is MB).



## About the project

In this project we were supposed to apply the Human-computer interaction concepts that we have learning during the semester. We have chosen to develop a web app to track series and movies watching.



## Test it

You can see a live demo of this repository at https://ihc.gmatos.pt/.

To test its functionalities you can log in with the following data:

## Development process

Focused on the UI and UX, we have followed a user-centric development approach that consisted of 3 phases.

1. Requirement analysis;
2. Low fidelity prototype;
3. Second prototype (the code on this repository).



## Technology stack

For the low fidelity prototype we have used [Balsamiq Cloud](https://balsamiq.cloud/). For the second prototype we have adapted a template that we found online with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
